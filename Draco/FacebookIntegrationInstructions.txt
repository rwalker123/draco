0. Install the ASP.net facebook SDK from codeplex. I added the dll's needed for this to source control, so you shouldn't have to do this. 
	Just check the BIN folder in the solution to make sure you have facebook dlls.
 
1. Added the following line to c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file:
    
    127.0.0.1        swfacebooklocal.com
 
2. In the facebook application, changed all paths that had localhost to swfacebooklocal.com. I think the most important one is the 
	Canvas call-back url. My canvas callback url is:
 
http://swfacebooklocal.com:50945/Draco/AccountTypes/Golf/Individual/Forms/Facebook/Facebook.aspx
 
    Facebook.aspx is a new page I just created so if you want to use it, you will have to update from source control.
 
3. Make sure your facebook application is setup for IFrame and FBML. By default it was FBML for me.
 
4. Created a batch file to start the web server on my machine on port 50945:
    
    "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\DevServer\9.0\WebDev.WebServer.EXE" /port:50945 /vpath:/Draco /path:C:\Users\walker\source\DracoRedesign\Draco
 
    In my case, I am using port 50945. You would need to change the /path option to match where you store the code on your local machine.
 
5. Run the batch file to get the web server started.
 
At this point you should be able to go to Facebook and run your application, if you synced source code you should see something.
 
 
You can also run directly from developer studio which will make it much easier to debug. To run from developer studio, you just need to tell 
it to use the web server started by the batch file instead of a new web server every time. To do this, right click the web project, for me it 
is the tree node (C:\...\Draco\) right below the root solution node. Then select Propert Pages.You should see a dialog, on the right there is 
a selection called Start Options, click that. Next, in the server section select Use Custom Server. For the Base URL enter something like this:
 
http://localhost:50945/Draco - If you don't use port 50945, replace with whatver you used.
