User cannot change account type, remove from account setup page. <br />
Reorganize code so silverlight app doesn't need to use web services. Can't access database without webservices. 
Need to resolve issue of multiple URL's. Silverlight is ok with clientaccesspolicy.xml. 
I have no solution for Ajax as it appears that whatever URL the first webService, for example: www.detroitmsbl.com. Then if 
you access the site from www.bluewatermsbl.com, the web services will fail. I think it is best to remove any web services from
asp pages and only access web services from silverlight.  <br />
Login control needs to be redone, it does too much. <br />
