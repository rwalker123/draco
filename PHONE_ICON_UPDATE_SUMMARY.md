# Phone Icon Update Summary

## User Feedback
The user suggested that the phone icon would be more appropriate next to the contact information rather than next to the name, and should specifically indicate when there are 1 or more phone numbers available.

## Changes Made

### 1. **UserCard.tsx** - Removed phone icon from name column
**Before:**
- Phone icon appeared next to user name when contact details were available
- Used general `ContactIcon` for any contact details

**After:**
- Removed phone icon from the name column entirely
- Clean name display with just the person icon

### 2. **ContactInfoExpanded.tsx** - Cleaned up contact info display
**Before:**
- Used general `ContactIcon` for all contact information
- Showed individual phone chips for each phone number
- Had redundant icon next to name in contact info section

**After:**
- **Removed Redundant Icon**: No icon next to name in contact info section (cleaner display)
- **Consolidated Phone Chip**: Shows single phone chip when there are 1 or more phone numbers
- **Clean Visual Hierarchy**: Name appears without redundant icons in contact section

## Technical Implementation

### Clean Display Logic
```typescript
// Simple name display without redundant icons
<Typography variant="body2" fontWeight="bold">
  {firstName} {lastName}
</Typography>

// Phone chip detection
{(contactDetails?.phone1 || contactDetails?.phone2 || contactDetails?.phone3) && (
  <Chip label="ðŸ“ž" size="small" variant="outlined" />
)}
```

### Phone Number Detection
- Direct check for `phone1`, `phone2`, `phone3` fields
- Shows phone chip when any phone number is available
- Simplified logic without utility function dependency

### Visual Improvements
1. **Clean Name Display**: No redundant icons next to name in contact info section
2. **Specific Indication**: Phone chip only shows when there are actual phone numbers
3. **Clean Name Column**: Name column is now cleaner without extra icons
4. **Simplified Layout**: Contact info section has cleaner, less cluttered appearance

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Contact information section is cleaner and less cluttered
2. **Clearer Indication**: Phone chip specifically indicates phone number availability
3. **Cleaner Design**: Name column and contact info section are both less cluttered
4. **Logical Grouping**: Contact-related chips are grouped together
