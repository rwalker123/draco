    - [ ] `batstatsum` table - ID sequence out of sync
    - [ ] `pitchstatsum` table - ID sequence out of sync  
    - [ ] `golfleaguesetup` table - ID sequence out of sync
  - [ ] Run PostgreSQL sequence reset commands:
    ```sql
    SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('batstatsum', 'id'), (SELECT MAX(id) FROM batstatsum));
    SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('pitchstatsum', 'id'), (SELECT MAX(id) FROM pitchstatsum));
    SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('golfleaguesetup', 'id'), (SELECT MAX(id) FROM golfleaguesetup));
    ```
  - [ ] Test sequence fixes with data insertion operations

- [ ] **Database Schema - DivisionDefs Naming Uniqueness**
