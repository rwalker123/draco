# PlayerClassifieds Feature Development

## Overview
The PlayerClassifieds feature allows teams to post "Players Wanted" ads and individual players to post "Teams Wanted" ads within a baseball account. This creates a classifieds board where teams can find players and players can find teams.

## Feature Description
- **Players Wanted**: Teams/coaches can post ads looking for players with specific positions and experience
- **Teams Wanted**: Individual players can post ads looking for teams to join
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic notifications when new ads are posted
- **Access Control**: Secure editing with access codes for public submissions
- **Expiration Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired classifieds

## Database Schema
The feature uses two existing tables in the Prisma schema:

### playerswantedclassified
```sql
- id: BigInt (Primary Key)
- accountid: BigInt (Foreign Key to accounts)
- datecreated: DateTime @db.Date
- createdbycontactid: BigInt (Foreign Key to contacts)
- teameventname: String @db.VarChar(50)
- description: String (unlimited text)
- positionsneeded: String @db.VarChar(100) // Enhanced to support string IDs like 'pitcher,catcher,first-base'

-- Recommended additions for enhanced functionality:
-- expirationdate: DateTime @db.Date
-- isactive: Boolean @default(true)
-- lastmodified: DateTime @default(now())
-- viewcount: Int @default(0)
-- emailnotifications: Boolean @default(true)
```

### teamswantedclassified
```sql
- id: BigInt (Primary Key)

##### **Phase 2b: Detailed Development Plan**

###### **Architecture Analysis & Pattern Consistency**

**Established Patterns Identified:**
1. **Component Structure**: Client wrapper pattern with server-side metadata generation
2. **State Management**: Custom hooks with centralized business logic
3. **Service Layer**: API service classes with consistent error handling
4. **Dialog Pattern**: Reusable confirmation and form dialogs
5. **Permission System**: Role-based access control with ProtectedRoute
6. **UI Components**: Material-UI with consistent theming and layout
7. **Error Handling**: Centralized notification system with user feedback
8. **Loading States**: Consistent loading state management across components

**DRY & SOLID Principles Applied:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component/hook has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Components accept props for extensibility
- **Liskov Substitution**: Interfaces ensure consistent behavior
- **Interface Segregation**: Specific interfaces for different use cases
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies injected through props and hooks

###### **Implementation Strategy**

**Component Architecture Pattern:**
```typescript
// Consistent with existing patterns
interface ComponentProps {
  accountId: string;
  // Component-specific props
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ accountId, ...props }) => {
  // Use custom hooks for business logic
  const { data, loading, actions } = useCustomHook(accountId);
  
  // Consistent error handling
  const { showNotification } = useNotifications();
  
  // Consistent loading states
  if (loading) return <SkeletonLoader />;
  
  return (
    // Component JSX
  );
};
```

**Hook Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
// Consistent with useUserManagement pattern
export const usePlayerClassifieds = (accountId: string) => {
  // State management
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  
  // API operations
  const operations = useMemo(() => ({
    create: async (data) => { /* implementation */ },
    update: async (id, data) => { /* implementation */ },
    delete: async (id) => { /* implementation */ },
  }), [accountId]);
  
  // Return consistent interface
  return {
    ...state,
    ...operations,
  };
};
```

**Service Layer Pattern:**
```typescript
// Consistent with existing service patterns
export const playerClassifiedService = {
  async createPlayersWanted(accountId: string, data: IPlayersWantedCreateRequest) {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/accounts/${accountId}/player-classifieds/players-wanted`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('authToken')}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to create Players Wanted: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    return response.json();
  },
};
```

## Security Requirements

### **Input Validation and Sanitization**
- **HTML Sanitization**: All text inputs sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- **Field Length Limits**: Enforce database field constraints
- **Email Validation**: RFC-compliant email format validation
- **Phone Validation**: Standardized phone number format with country code support
- **Date Validation**: Birth date must be reasonable (13-80 years old)
- **Position Validation**: Limit to predefined baseball positions

### **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**
```typescript
// Rate limiting configuration
const rateLimits = {
  playersWanted: {
    perContact: '5 posts per hour',
    perAccount: '20 posts per hour'
  },
  teamsWanted: {
    perIP: '3 posts per hour',
    perEmail: '1 post per 24 hours'
  },
  search: {
    perIP: '100 requests per minute'
  }
};
```

### **CAPTCHA Integration**
- **Anonymous Submissions**: CAPTCHA required for all teams wanted ads
- **Suspicious Activity**: Trigger CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts
- **Integration**: Use Google reCAPTCHA v3 with score-based validation

### **Access Code Security**
- **Generation**: Cryptographically secure UUID generation
- **Storage**: Store hashed access codes in database
- **Transmission**: Send access codes via encrypted email only
- **Expiration**: Access codes expire after 90 days of inactivity
- **Validation**: Rate limit access code attempts (5 per hour per IP)

### **Email Verification System**
```typescript
// Email verification workflow
const emailVerification = {
  required: true, // For all teams wanted submissions
  expirationTime: '24 hours',
  maxResendAttempts: 3,
  resendCooldown: '15 minutes'
};
```

### **Audit Logging**
- **All Operations**: Log create, update, delete operations with timestamps
- **Authentication Events**: Log login attempts and access code usage
- **Admin Actions**: Detailed logging of all admin override actions
- **IP Tracking**: Record IP addresses for all anonymous submissions
- **Data Retention**: Keep audit logs for 1 year minimum

## Business Logic

### Access Control
- **PlayersWantedClassified**: Any authenticated account member (contactcreatorid = account) can create/edit/delete their own ads; Account admins can manage all
- **TeamsWantedClassified**: Any authenticated account member (contactcreatorid = account) can create; edit/delete requires access code for anonymous submissions or creator/admin permissions for authenticated users
- **Admin Override**: Account admins can manage all classifieds regardless of creator
- **Account Boundary**: All operations strictly within account boundaries
- **Role Validation**: Use existing RoleContext for permission checks and account membership validation

### **Automatic Expiration System**
```typescript
// Expiration configuration
const expirationConfig = {
  playersWanted: {
    defaultDays: 30,
    maxDays: 90,
    reminderDays: [7, 3, 1] // Days before expiration to send reminders
  },
  teamsWanted: {
    defaultDays: 60,
    maxDays: 120,
    reminderDays: [14, 7, 3, 1]
  },
  cleanupSchedule: 'daily at 2:00 AM' // Background job schedule
};
```

### **Smart Matching Algorithm**
- **Position Matching**: Automatic matching between teams looking for specific positions and players who play those positions
- **Experience Level**: Match experience requirements with player experience
- **Geographic Proximity**: Consider account location for local matches (if available)
- **Age Compatibility**: Match age-appropriate players with teams
- **Availability Overlap**: Consider posted availability windows

### **Email Notifications**
- **New Players Wanted Ad**: 
  - Notify all active teams wanted ads with matching positions
  - Send weekly digest to account subscribers
- **New Teams Wanted Ad**: 
  - Notify teams looking for matching positions
  - Send to team administrators and contact admins
- **Teams Wanted Registration**: 
  - Send access code and verification email to submitter
  - Include instructions for editing/deleting
- **Expiration Reminders**: 
  - Notify creators before classified expires
  - Offer one-click renewal option
- **Match Suggestions**: 
  - Weekly email with potential matches based on algorithm
  - Allow users to opt-out of specific notification types

### **Cross-Notification Strategy**
```typescript
// Notification triggers
const notificationTriggers = {
  onPlayersWantedCreated: [
    'notifyMatchingTeamsWanted',
    'addToWeeklyDigest',
    'updateSearchIndexes'
  ],
  onTeamsWantedCreated: [
    'sendVerificationEmail',
    'notifyMatchingPlayersWanted',
    'triggerMatchingAlgorithm'
  ],
  onExpirationApproaching: [
    'sendReminderEmail',
    'offerRenewalOption',
    'suggestionAlternativeActions'
  ]
};
```

### Data Validation
- Required fields validation
- Email format validation using express-validator
- Phone number format validation with international support
- Position validation using string IDs (pitcher, catcher, first-base, etc.)
- Experience text limits and sanitization
- Date range validation for birth dates (13-80 years old)
- HTML sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Input length and format restrictions

## Configuration
- **Expiration Days**: Configurable via environment variable (`CLASSIFIEDS_EXPIRATION_DAYS`)
- **Email Templates**: Customizable via email template system
- **Access Code Expiry**: Configurable timeout for access codes (`ACCESS_CODE_EXPIRY_DAYS`)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits per environment (`RATE_LIMIT_*`)
- **Matching Algorithm**: Configurable weights for different matching criteria
- **CAPTCHA Settings**: Configurable score thresholds and site keys

## Advanced Features

### **Full-Text Search Implementation**
```typescript
// Search configuration
const searchConfig = {
  indexedFields: [
    'teameventname', 'description', 'positionsneeded', // Players wanted
    'name', 'experience', 'positionsplayed' // Teams wanted
  ],
  searchWeights: {
    positionsneeded: 3.0,
    positionsplayed: 3.0,
    teameventname: 2.0,
    description: 1.0,
    experience: 1.5
  },
  resultRanking: 'relevance + recency + view_count'
};
```

### **Analytics and Reporting Dashboard**

  availabilityWeight: 0.2,  // Time availability overlap
  proximityWeight: 0.1,     // Geographic proximity (if available)
  
  scoringThresholds: {
    excellent: 0.8,    // 80%+ match score
    good: 0.6,         // 60-79% match score
    fair: 0.4          // 40-59% match score
  }
};
```

### **Social Integration Features**

## Technical Architecture

### **Caching Strategy**
```typescript
// Caching configuration
const cacheConfig = {
  classifiedsList: {
    ttl: '5 minutes',    // Recent listings cache
    invalidateOn: ['create', 'update', 'delete']
  },
  searchResults: {
    ttl: '15 minutes',   // Search query results
    keyStrategy: 'hash(query + filters + sort)'
  },
  matchingSuggestions: {
    ttl: '1 hour',       // Matching algorithm results
    backgroundRefresh: true
  },
  accountStats: {
    ttl: '1 hour',       // Analytics and stats
    refreshSchedule: 'hourly'
  }
};
```

- [ ] **Content Liability**: Who is responsible for classified content - poster or platform?
- [ ] **COPPA Compliance**: Special considerations for users under 13?

## Recommended Decisions (Based on Analysis)

### **High Priority - Needed Before Phase 1**
1. **Moderation Workflow**: Recommend auto-publish with post-moderation for faster user experience
2. **Expiration Timeframes**: Use proposed timeframes (30/60 days) with option to configure per account
3. **Search Technology**: Start with database full-text search, plan migration to Elasticsearch in Phase 3
4. **Background Jobs**: Integrate with existing job queue system for consistency

### **Medium Priority - Needed Before Phase 2**
1. **Photo Support**: Implement in Phase 2 with existing file upload infrastructure
2. **Geographic Features**: Add in Phase 3 if account location data becomes available
3. **Contact Method**: Force communication through system initially, allow direct contact in Phase 4
4. **Experience Levels**: Define 4 standard levels with free-text additional details

### **Low Priority - Decide During Development**
1. **Payment Features**: Not needed for Phase 1, evaluate demand after launch
2. **Calendar Integration**: Consider for Phase 4 based on user feedback
3. **International Support**: Evaluate based on account growth patterns
